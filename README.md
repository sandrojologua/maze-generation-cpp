# maze-generation-cpp

This is a maze generation program which first generates the maze and then solves it.

To generate a maze, it uses Randomized Kruskal's algorithm.
For more details about an algorithm itself, check [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_generation_algorithm#Randomized_Kruskal's_algorithm) out.

To solve it, it uses depth-first search.
